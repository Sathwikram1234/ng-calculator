# Angular Calculator Application

This is a fully functional, responsive calculator web application built with modern Angular 19. The project features a clean, modern user interface with three switchable color themes and is structured using the latest Angular features like Standalone Components and Signals for state management. It serves as a practical example of building a modern frontend application with a clear separation of concerns, reusable components, and an injectable service for logic.
